  "description" : "This mod is a variant of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/aremnir]Armok's[/url] mod, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2297678548]Longer Scan Quests[/url].\n\nAs stated in their description, Longer Scan Quests seeks to mandate more exploration with the scan quests by lengthening the target value needed to progress - requiring about 30% more scanning.  Idea being, you may need to visit more planets and dungeons to move things along, and thus explore more of the universe before progressing the story.  That mod works great and just as intended, unless you [i]also[/i] use Frackin Universe.  \n\nAt the time of this writing, FU includes it's own changes to the scanning quests: it makes them shorter -  but not by a means that is actually incompatible with Longer Scan Quests.  FU doubles and sometimes triples the [i]scan value[/i] of the available objects (visible [url=https://github.com/sayterdarkwynd/FrackinUniverse/commit/b26fe21372f974fbbcbb447c5d8cd3ac5ce8ee6a#diff-bd783f10437786318a6a43e376d63ed6c52405e697cc8250c07417455b85683d]here[/url]), while leaving the [i]target value[/i] alone.  This means that the higher target value of \"Longer Scan Quests\" is still applied, but it doesn't really achieve the intended result. You still need to hit a scanned value of 30% more than the vanilla value, but FU is giving you 2-3 times as much scanning per pop.  So it's kinda a wash.\n\nThis version increases the target value by about 290% (or 145) - significantly more than vanilla or Longer Scan Quests, but thanks to FU increasing the scan values by 200%-300%, it should even out to about the same as using Longer Scan Quests on vanilla.\n\n[h2] Dependencies [/h2]\n\nNone, actually.  While this mod is [i]for FU[/i], it doesn't require it.  You could also use it with vanilla to achieve a slightly less punishing form of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=850334002]Clue Hell[/url] (I actually went ahead and set the \"glitch\" quest requirement to 143 in case anyone wants to use it that way.  That is exactly the Clue Hell value, but everything else is around 30 points lower than that mod).\n\nYou also can't use this mod with the orignal Longer Scan Quests or anything else that patches \"/scriptConfig/targetValue\" of the \"quest/story/*_mission1\" quests.  They'll override each other, and you'll lose one of the changes.\n\n[h2] Credits [/h2]\n\n [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/aremnir]Armok[/url] - for the orginal \"Longer Scan Quests\" mod, and a host of other awesome things.  Seriously, go dig through their modpage if you're modding this game.  You'll be glad you did :)",
